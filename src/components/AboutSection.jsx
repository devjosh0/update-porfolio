          I'm a Software Test Engineer with over two years of hands-on experience in both manual and automated testing. I’m passionate about delivering high-quality software through meticulous testing strategies that ensure performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.
Throughout my career, I’ve worked on a range of projects, from agile web applications to enterprise-level systems, developing test plans, writing robust test cases, and automating regression suites to improve development cycles. My approach balances analytical thinking with a strong attention to detail, helping teams catch issues early and ship with confidence.
I thrive in collaborative environments where quality is a shared responsibility, and I’m always eager to learn, adapt, and grow with new challenges in the ever-evolving tech space.
